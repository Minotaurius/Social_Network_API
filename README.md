# Social Media API Application

## Description

This is an example of an API built for a social media platform. This API was built using MongoDB and Mongoose. It stores users, users thoughts, reactions to thoughts, and even allows people to add and remove friends! All routes and requests were tested through Insomnia.

## Installation

In order to get your own copy of the Social Media API, you just need to navigate to the repo and copy the link to the repo. Once you have that on your clipboard navigate to VS Code and run 'git clone ____' and paste the link in the blank space. Once you have that done make sure you CD into your new repo or directory and run "npm init -y &&& install" to download any required packages. Then run "npm start" to bring the server online. From there you will need either Insomnia (showcased in demo) or HTTP files (what I used while creating routes to test in VS Code) to interact with the database.

## Usage

This was built to show an understanding of sending information through a database and being able to have the data interact with each other. Was done on a small scale for this example but this could absolutely be scaled to a large social media platform thanks to MongoDBs speed when handling large data and the control the user has over the data on the back end.
